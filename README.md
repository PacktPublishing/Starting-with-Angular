This is the code repository for Starting with Angular [Video](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/starting-angular-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
To keep this course on the cutting edge of Angular technology and be consistent in providing instruction for the features found in the latest Angular release (v4.3)

In this update we addressed the major changes in the Angular version 4.3 release (scheduled for early July 2017). Per our course content, including hands-on coding exercises, there were a few breaking changes in the 4.3 beta/rc releases which ripped across much of the original project code and also included minor, non-breaking changes which outdated certain aspects of our original content. With this update we were also able to comfortably include an entirely new course content section focusing on the Angular Forms module. This Angular module has stabilized enough in the v.4.3 release to be included in the course.
